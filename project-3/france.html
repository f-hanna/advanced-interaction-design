                    <h4>
                        French Classicism
                    </h4>

                        Mid 1600s - Early 1700s

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Much like the rest of Europe, French Classicism was deeply influenced by the principles of order
                        and reason derived from ancient Greek and Roman art.
                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        However, the French Classicism period was unique compared to the rest of Europe because the arts
                        were heavily utilized to glorify King Louis XIV, the Sun King. Under his rule, France saw the
                        centralization of power, the establishment of absolute monarchy, and the consolidation of French
                        cultural influence in Europe.
                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Another notable aspect of this time frame was the French Salons, a social gathering where a
                        guests discussed not only art, but also literature, philosophy, music, and politics. The
                        democratization of ideas set the roots for the Age of Enlightment, and would set up France as an
                        intellectual powerhouse in Europe.

                        Rococo

                        Early 1700s - Mid 1700s

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        The Rococo period emerged as a reponse to the Classicism era, known for its ornate and playful
                        aesthetic compared to Classicism's focus on reason, mirroring France's frivolous spending by the
                        aristocracy.
                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        This era revolved around the aristocracy, who moved from Versailles to Paris, embracing leisure
                        and indulging in romantic intrigues, creating a culture of luxury and excess. This contrasted
                        sharply with the majority of French society, as the aristocracy, a small fraction of the
                        population, owned 90% the country's wealth.

                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        While the aristocracy controlled and spent a majority of the country's finances, the common
                        people were effectvely starving, especially as France's economy could no longer handle th
                        aristocrat's luxurious lifestyle. This anger and frustration towards aristocracy would culminate
                        in the French Revolution, which would effectly cause Rococo to heavly decline.

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Neoclassicism emerged as a reaction to the frivolity and excessive ornament of the baroque and
                        rococo styles, invoking themes of harmony, rationality, stoicism, universality, and idealism
                        based off the ancient Romans and Greeks.

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        The age of Enlightenment was one of the biggest influences of not only France, but also Europe.
                        The philosophical ideas of individual liberty, constitutional government, and seperation of
                        church and state. These ideas permeated into Neoclassicism themes.

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        This era also served as the backdrop to one of France's most politically tumultuous era: the
                        bloody French Revolution, the Napoleon's militarisic empire, the industrialization of France.
                        Feelings such as nationalism evoked from these events were translated into Neoclassicism
                        paintings.

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Romanticists embraced subjectivity, imagination, and appreciation of nature. Rejecting
                        rationality and stoicism, Romanticism is best defined by its focus on emotion and individualism
                        as well as the glorification of the past and nature.
                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        During the Industrial Revolution, Romanicists grew disillusioned with the rapid progress,
                        especially as industrialization exposed the dehumanizing effects of mechanization, urbanization,
                        and capitalist exploitation. As such, artists longed for a more harmonious and natural way of
                        life.

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        The movement was arguably a reaction against Enlightenment, challenging it's emphasis on reason,
                        rationality, and order. Romanticism instead celebrated emotion, individualism, imagination, and
                        the sublime.

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Impressionism was focused on capturing contemporary life and the ephemeral effects of light and
                        color, viewing these as a crucial element of human perception and experience. </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">
                        Similar to Romanticists, Impressionist art also responded to rapid industrialization. Rather
                        than rejecting urbanization, artists focused on the modern contemporary life, capturing fleeting
                        moments in the bustling city, reflecting the dynamism and energy of urban existence. Inventions
                        such as the camera inspired artists: artists wanted to emulate the camera's ability to capture
                        spontaneous moments and fleeting effects of light.

                    </p>

                    <p class="plaque-text">

                        Impressionism also reflected the demographic shifts of the time. With industrialization emerged
                        a new economic class: the middle class. This economic expansion created new consumer markets and
                        cultural tastes. Leisure acitivities that previously was rstricted to the aristocrats could now
                        be enjoyed by more people.
